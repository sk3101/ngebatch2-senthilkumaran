# Functional Programming Workshop

## Setup

Before you do anything else, read through the code in exercise-1.js and make sure you understand what it is doing.

Run the code with `node exercise-1/2/3/4.js` to help you do this.

Some extra `console.logs` may also help ;-)

## The Tasks

You need to find the name of a user's favourite food but all you have to go on is the user's name, so you will need two steps:

- Query the data (`userData`) by a user's `name` to find their favourite food's `id`
- Query the data (`foodData`) by the food `id` to find the food's `name`

**Be sure to ask your instructor for feedback as you complete each step**
